# Conference Management Tool for ICAF
**This is the developer guide for the Conference Management Tool for "International Conference on Application Frameworks" also known as [ICAF](https://icaf-sliit.herokuapp.com/).** 

**To get a more technical idea of the system use our [technical report](reports/technicalReport.pdf ':ignore'). Checkout our [user guide](userGuide.md) if you're new here.**
<hr />

## Rest API

The backend of the conference management tool is a RESTful API running JSON based web services, and implemented with Node.js and Express.js

### Getting started

#### Cloning

First, the project is needed to be cloned to your local space.

`git clone https://github.com/rukshan99/api-ICAF`

Since the API uses MongoDB atlas as the database, [a cluster should be created](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) and the connection string sould be added to a `.env` file in the project root.

#### Installing packages

Install the required dependencies needed in both development and production as defined in the `package.json`.

Run `npm install` in your CLI.

#### Development mode

You can test the API endpoints using an API tester like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). To do that, run `npm start` in your CLI to run the server in development mode.

Server will restart automatically if you do any edits.

#### Testing

API testing is handled using Jest framework and MongoDB-memory-saver package. Jest provides 
methods to create, organize and run the tests. The mongodb-memory server creates a cluster which 
only exists in the deviceâ€™s main memory and is not physically stored to disk. Therefore, once the 
application terminates, the database instance will no longer exist.

To run the test cases use `npm test` in your terminal.

## React App

The frontend of the system is based on React related technologies and it consumes the JSON based service endpoints of the REST API.

### Getting started

#### Cloning

First, the project is needed to be cloned to your local space.

`git clone https://github.com/rukshan99/app-ICAF`

#### Installing packages

Install the required dependencies needed in both development and production as defined in the `package.json`.

Run `npm install` in your CLI.

#### Development mode

To run the app in the development mode use `npm start` in your CLI.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Testing

React component testing and snapshot testing was done using Jest and Enzyme.

Run `npm test` in the CLI to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### Preparing for deployment

Run `npm run build` in your CLI to build the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
